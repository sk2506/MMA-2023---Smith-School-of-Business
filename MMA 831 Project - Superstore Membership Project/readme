The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of existing customers purchasing the gold membership offer during the year-end sale. By analyzing customer data, the project aims to identify key factors that influence their decision to purchase the membership. This will enable the superstore to target customers more effectively, thereby reducing the overall cost of the phone call campaign and optimizing the campaignâ€™s efficiency.
